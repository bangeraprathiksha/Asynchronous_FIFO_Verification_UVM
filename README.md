# Asynchronous_FIFO_Verification_UVM
UVM-based verification for an asynchronous FIFO, including RTL, agents, sequences, drivers, monitors, and scoreboard. Tests read/write operations, full/empty flags, and reset behavior with constrained random testing, coverage, and assertions for robust verification.

This project implements a UVM-based verification environment for an asynchronous FIFO. It verifies read/write operations, full/empty flags, and reset behavior.

Features
RTL design of asynchronous FIFO
UVM testbench: agents, sequences, drivers, monitors
Scoreboard for result checking
Constrained random testing
Assertion checks

Functional coverage collection
